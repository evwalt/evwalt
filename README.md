# Welcome 👋🏼

I thoroughly enjoy building software. I'm a software engineer with a frontend-leaning, full-stack focus and 5+ years of experience building scalable, accessible, and high-performance web applications with React and TypeScript. I design AI-powered systems that combine strong technical craft with product thinking, enabling products to scale reliably as teams and users grow.

I appeared as a guest on [The React Show](https://podcast.thereactshow.com/1764837/12142504) podcast!

I enjoy building and using CLI tools and customizing my development environment with tools like Neovim ([lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)), window management via [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/evan-walter/dotfiles/blob/main/.hammerspoon/init.lua), and voice-driven workflows with [Talon](https://github.com/evwalt/talonhub-community). You can view my [Neovim configuration here](https://github.com/evwalt/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim).

I use a tented [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) keyboard with the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) layout and custom [QMK](https://qmk.fm) firmware 🤓. Previously, I used the [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep).

Other than coding 👨🏼‍💻, I enjoy fitness 💪🏼, hiking 🥾, traveling ✈️, outdoor activities 🌊, and hanging out with family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.
