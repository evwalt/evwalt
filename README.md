# Hi, I'm Evan 👋🏼

Welcome! I really like coding and building software. My background is full-stack engineering with a frontend lean. In my professional experience, I've focused on building scalable, user-focused applications. Skilled in TypeScript, React, and Node.js. Adept at designing frontend architectures, building APIs and services, and delivering responsive, data-rich applications with AI integration.

I had the privilege of appearing as a guest on [The React Show](https://podcast.thereactshow.com/1764837/12142504) podcast!

I also enjoy CLI tools and ricing my dev environment with tools like Neovim ([lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)); window management with [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/evan-walter/dotfiles/blob/main/.hammerspoon/init.lua); [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest); and [Talon](https://github.com/evwalt/talonhub-community).

I really enjoy my tented [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) keyboard and, as of recently, my [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) with the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) keyboard layout and my [QMK](https://qmk.fm) customizations 🤓.

I'm also interested in programming languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [Go](https://go.dev), and [Java](https://dev.java).

Other than coding 👨🏼‍💻, I enjoy fitness 💪🏼, hiking 🥾, traveling ✈️, outdoor activities 🌊, and hanging out with family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.
