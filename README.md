# Hi, I'm Evan 👋🏻

I currently work as a Full-Stack Development Consultant at [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en.html). I specialize in TypeScript, React, and Node.js.

I had the privilege of appearing as a guest on [The React Show](https://podcast.thereactshow.com/1764837/12142504) podcast!

I'm a fan of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and I'm interested in programming languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Go](https://go.dev).

Lately, I've been exploring [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org); [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org); window management with [Hammerspoon](https://github.com/evan-walter/dotfiles/blob/main/.hammerspoon/init.lua) and [i3](https://i3wm.org); [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/latest); and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).

I really enjoy my [Ferris Sweep keyboard](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) tented nearly vertically with the [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) layout and [QMK](https://qmk.fm) customizations 🤓.

Other than coding 👨🏼‍💻, I enjoy fitness 💪🏻, hiking 🥾, traveling ✈️, outdoor activities 🌊, and hanging out with family and friends 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.
